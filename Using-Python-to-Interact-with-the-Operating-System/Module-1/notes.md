# Using Python to Interact with the Operating System  
## Module 1: Getting Your Python On

### Course Context
- This is the second course in the Google IT Automation with Python specialization.
- Builds on the Crash Course on Python:
  - Python syntax, conditionals, loops, functions, classes
  - Data structures: strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries
  - Importing and using Python modules
- Requires basic OS knowledge:
  - Files, directories, file systems
  - Processes
  - Log files

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Environment Setup
- Install Python from the official Python website or package managers:
  - Windows: Chocolatey
  - macOS: Homebrew
  - Linux: package managers (apt, yum, etc.)
- Use `pip` to manage Python modules.
- Set up code editors/IDEs:
  - Eclipse, PyCharm, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code
  - Jupyter Notebooks, Colab for interactive coding
- Practice writing and running Python scripts locally.

#### 2. Using Qwiklabs
- Provides temporary access to cloud-based environments.
- Useful for practicing OS-level automation tasks.
- Helps simulate real-world IT workflows.

#### 3. Automation Value
- Automating tasks saves time and reduces repetitive work.
- Formula for ROI of automation:  

time_to_automate < (time_to_perform * amount_of_times_done)

- **Example:** Automating a 40-minute weekly process takes 10 hours (600 minutes) to build.
- 600 < 40x → x > 15 weeks
- After 15 weeks, automation starts saving time.
- Soft ROI: boosts morale, collaboration, and reduces boredom.

#### 4. Career Identity
- Build your **career identity statement**: describe your unique value, strengths, and goals.
- Helps in tailoring career path and professional choices.

#### 5. Resources for Learning
- *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* (book/online)
- *Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python*
- Python official documentation
- Encourage research and independent learning to stay current.

### Glossary
- **Interpreter**: Executes code line by line.
- **Compiled language**: Translates code into machine instructions.
- **Kernel**: Core of the OS managing hardware and resources.
- **User space**: Where applications and user processes run.
- **Virtual environment**: Isolated Python environment for project dependencies.
- **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
- **Linux, macOS, Windows**: Examples of operating systems.

### Takeaways
- Set up Python, package managers, and code editors for automation tasks.
- Qwiklabs provides real-world, cloud-based practice environments.
- Automation adds both hard ROI (time saved) and soft ROI (employee satisfaction).
- Career identity shapes your learning and professional goals.
- Use official docs and community resources for continuous learning.
