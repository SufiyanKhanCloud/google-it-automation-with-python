# Google IT Automation with Python
## Course 1 â€“ Module 1: Introduction to Automation and Python Basics

---

## 1. Uses for Automation
Automation replaces repetitive manual tasks with automatic processes, reducing human error and increasing efficiency.

**Appropriate Uses for Automation**
- Timing/regulation of traffic lights
- Repetitive tasks prone to human error
- Sending computer commands
- Detecting/removing duplicate data
- Sending personalized automated emails
- Updating file permissions
- System resource reporting (disk, memory usage)
- Software installation and deployment
- Generating reports
- Deploying software patches via configuration management tools
- Populating e-commerce sites with products
- Setting up user directories and permissions

**Tasks Unsuitable for Full Automation**
- Creative tasks (e.g., designing websites, photography)
- Human evaluation and analysis (e.g., hiring, troubleshooting)
- Tasks requiring human interaction and psychology
- Physical tasks that cannot be automated (hardware repair)
- Costly or unsafe full automation scenarios

## 2. Automation vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Automation**: Explicitly coded instructions for tasks.
- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Machine learning allows systems to perform complex tasks without explicitly programmed instructions.

## 3. Key Programming Concepts

**Programming Code**  
Set of written instructions for computers, using programming languages.

**Programming Languages Examples**: Python, Java, C++, C#, R.  
- **Syntax**: Rules for structuring code (order, special characters, punctuation).  
- **Semantics**: Meaning and logic behind code.

**Computer Program**: Step-by-step instructions to achieve a goal; can be complex and long.  
**Script**: Shorter, less complex, often for automation.

## 4. Python Overview
- **General Purpose**: Used in IT support, system admin, web dev, ML, data analytics.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS, IoT, mobile devices.
- **Beginner-friendly**: Syntax resembles English.

**Python IS**:
- General-purpose scripting language
- Cross-platform
- Used in automation and application development

**Python IS NOT**:
- OS-specific
- Purely object-oriented
- Client-side scripting language

## 5. Syntax & Semantic Errors

**Syntax Errors** (code won't run):
- Misspellings
- Wrong brackets or quotes
- Incorrect indentation
- Missing keywords or punctuation

**Semantic Errors** (code runs but gives wrong output):
- Logical flaws in code design
- Incorrect intended output

---

## 6. First Python Concepts
**Functions**: Reusable blocks of code (e.g., `print()` function).  
**Keywords**: Reserved words with special meaning (`if`, `else`, `def`, `return`, etc.).  
**Arithmetic Operators**:
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `**` Exponentiation
- `//` Floor Division
- `%` Modulo

**Order of Operations (PEMDAS)**:
1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents `**`
3. Multiplication/Division
4. Addition/Subtraction

## 7. Glossary (Quick Reference)
- **Automation**: Replacing manual steps with automatic processes.
- **Syntax**: Structure and rules of code.
- **Semantics**: Meaning/logic of code.
- **Variable**: Stores changeable values.
- **Function**: Block of reusable code.
- **Interpreter**: Executes code.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Treats code components as configurable objects.
- **Machine Language**: Binary code instructions for computers.
