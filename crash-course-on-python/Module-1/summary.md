# Module 1: Crash Course on Python  
*Google IT Automation with Python Specialization*

## Overview
This module introduces Python as a general-purpose scripting language widely used in DevOps, automation, and system administration. It explains why automation matters, how Python fits into modern IT workflows, and foundational programming concepts.

## Key Concepts

### Automation vs Human Work
- Automation replaces repetitive manual steps with consistent, error-free scripts.
- Appropriate for tasks like software deployment, permission updates, report generation.
- Not appropriate for work needing creativity, deep human judgment, or physical constraints (e.g., hiring decisions, design aesthetics, hardware repair).

### Automation vs Artificial Intelligence
- Automation executes explicit instructions given by humans.
- Artificial Intelligence learns patterns via machine learning to perform tasks without explicit step-by-step programming.

## Core Programming Concepts

### Terms
- **Programming code:** Instructions written in a language (like a recipe) for a computer to execute.
- **Syntax:** Rules for constructing valid statements in code (similar to grammar).
- **Semantics:** The intended meaning or logic behind correct syntax; logical errors arise here.
- **Script:** Shorter code meant to automate specific tasks.
- **Function:** Reusable block of code performing a defined task.
- **Variable:** Storage for changeable values that code can manipulate.
- **Input/Output:** Input is data provided to a program; output is what the program returns or displays.

## Python Characteristics
- General purpose, cross-platform, beginner-friendly.
- Commonly used for automation, system administration, web services, scripting.
- Not platform or OS specific; not strictly object-oriented; syntax resembles English.

## Basic Syntax Examples

**Print to screen (Python):**
```python
print("Hello, how are you?")
