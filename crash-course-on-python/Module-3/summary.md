#  Summary: Crash Course on Python â€“ Module 3

In **Module 3** of the *Google IT Automation with Python* specialization, I explored the fundamentals of **functions**, **code reuse**, **scope**, and **modular code** â€” all essential concepts for writing clean, maintainable, and reusable automation scripts.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

- **Functions** allow you to reuse logic and avoid repetition.
- The `def` keyword is used to define a function.
- **Parameters** and **return values** make functions dynamic and flexible.
- **Docstrings** document what a function does, improving readability.
- **Local and global scope** determine where variables are accessible.
- Modular code is easier to debug, maintain, and reuse.

This foundation is highly relevant in **DevOps** environments, where writing reusable and maintainable automation scripts is a core skill.
