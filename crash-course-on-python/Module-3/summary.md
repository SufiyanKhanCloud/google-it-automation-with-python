# 📄 Module 3 Summary — Google IT Automation with Python
## LOOPS

---

### 🔁 While Loops
- Repeats code while a condition is true.
- Update the loop variable to avoid infinite loops.
- Condition is checked before each iteration.

### 🔂 Infinite Loops
- Occur when the condition never becomes false.
- Use `Ctrl + C` to stop execution.

### 🛑 Break & Continue
- `break`: Exits loop immediately.
- `continue`: Skips current iteration and continues loop.

### 🔁 For Loops
- Iterates over sequences like lists, strings, and tuples.

### 🔢 range()
- Generates numeric sequences.
- Syntax: `range(start, stop, step)`

### ⛓️ Nested Loops
- A loop inside another loop.
- Useful for 2D data like grids/matrices.

### 🔍 Looping Through Strings
- Strings are iterable, loop through characters.

### 📌 Looping Through Lists
- Use `for` to iterate over elements.

### 📝 enumerate()
- Access both index and value during iteration.
- Syntax: `for index, value in enumerate(sequence)`

### 🧠 Quiz/Practice Refresher

- **`for i in range(3): print(i)`**
  - Output:  
    ```
    0  
    1  
    2
    ```

- **What does `break` do?**  
  - Exits the loop immediately.

- **What does `continue` do?**  
  - Skips to the next loop iteration.

### ✅ Common Patterns

- Countdown with `while`
- Looping over list with `for`
- Nested loops for 2D data
- Using `enumerate()` for indexed loops
