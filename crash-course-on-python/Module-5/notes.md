# Crash Course on Python  
## Module 5: Putting It All Together

### Key Concepts Covered

#### 1. Research and Planning Before Writing Scripts
- Importance of understanding the problem before coding
- Define inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Break down tasks into smaller steps
- Write pseudocode or flowcharts for clarity

#### 2. Writing Complete Scripts
- Using functions to organize code
- Implementing classes for structure and reusability
- Sorting data with built-in methods
- Handling events and subprocesses
- Working with files and directories using `pathlib`

#### 3. Real-World Automation Project
- Example: User account creation with CSV data
- Parsing CSV files with Python
- Using the `subprocess` module to execute system commands
- Storing sensitive data securely (secrets management)
- Automating repetitive administrative tasks

#### 4. Best Practices
- Code modularity (split tasks into functions/modules)
- Error handling with exceptions
- Documentation and readability
- Testing scripts before production use
- Version control (GitHub) for tracking changes

### Hands-on Exercises
- Writing a Python script that reads data from a file
- Automating system tasks with subprocess
- Building a complete automation workflow

### Glossary
- **Subprocess**: Module to spawn new processes, connect to input/output/error pipes, and obtain return codes
- **Pathlib**: Python module for object-oriented filesystem paths
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values, format for tabular data
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of passwords, keys, and credentials

### Takeaways
- Learned how to integrate all concepts (functions, loops, conditionals, data structures) into real-world scripts
- Understood importance of planning, testing, and documenting code
- Developed ability to write maintainable automation scripts useful in IT and DevOps workflows
