## Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries

---

- **Strings** are sequences of characters, indexed from 0, and immutable.
- You can multiply strings and slice parts using `[start:end]`.
- Common string methods include `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.strip()`, `.count()`, and `.replace()`.
- **Formatting strings** is easy with `.format()` or f-strings.
- **Lists** are ordered, mutable collections that support indexing, slicing, adding (`append()`), and removing items.
- **Looping** through strings and lists is done with `for` loops.
- **Dictionaries** store key-value pairs, are unordered (before Python 3.7), and are mutable.
- Use `.items()` to loop through keys and values.
- Key takeaway: strings immutable, lists mutable, dictionaries key-value stores.

## Key Methods and Functions:

- `len()`, `in`, `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.count()`, `.replace()`
- String formatting with `.format()` and f-strings

## Practice Tips:

- Practice indexing and slicing strings and lists.
- Use loops to iterate sequences.
- Manipulate dictionaries by adding, deleting, and looping key-value pairs.
